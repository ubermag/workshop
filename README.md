# Ubermag workshops

This repository contains several Ubermag workshops. The table below gives an
overview over the different workshops. The Jupyter notebooks used during these
workshops can be executed online using the `launch binder` buttons in the table.
The ubermag packages evolves and changes over time. The older workshops
therefore present the feature set available at the time when the workshop was
held and are not updated to reflect e.g. syntax or interface changes.

An always up-to-date set of tutorial notebooks is available on our website
([getting started](https://ubermag.github.io/getting-started/index.html) and
[examples](https://ubermag.github.io/examples/index.html)) and in the [tutorials
repository](https://github.com/ubermag/tutorials).
