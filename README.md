## About

This repository is a place where all the materials (slides, tutorials, and exercises) used in Ubermag workshops are stored.

1. The slides (as PDF) can be found in `slides` directory. The slides do not have animations in order to make sure the files are of reasonable size and accessible by everybody. If you want the full presentation in Keynote format, please let Marijan Beg know. The slides are going to be extended as we progress through other sessions.

2. Tutorials and exercises as Jupyter notebooks are available in `tutorials` directory. More will be added as we go through the workshop. They are also accessible via Binder.

3. The materials addressing (too) specific questions we did not have time to discuss during live sessions, are going to be available in `extras` directory.

This is a public repository and it can be seen by everybody. If you want to contribute to it, please be careful what data you share.

## Current workshop

The current workshop is divided into 4 sessions:

1. Friday 24 April 2020, 14:00-15:30 (UK time) - The basics of micromagnetics, Jupyter, and Python
2. Wednesday 29 April 2020, 14:00-15:30 (UK time) - Micromagnetics with Ubermag
3. Monday 4 May 2020, 14:00-15:30 (UK time) - Data analysis and visualisation with Ubermag 1
4. Thursday 14 May 2020, 14:00-15:30 (UK time) - Data analysis and visualisation with Ubermag 2

Optional follow-up sessions, depending on the requests and feedback might be organised in the future.

## What to do before the workshop?

1. The workshop will delivered using [Zoom](https://zoom.us). Please install it before the workshop and join the session using this link: https://us04web.zoom.us/j/74465485256. There is no need to create an account with Zoom.

2. To follow the tutorials and exercises, you do not need to install anything on your machine or download (clone) this repository. The tutorials and exercises can be run in the cloud and no files will be created on your machine. Ubermag in the cloud can be accessed using Binder badge in the table above. Starting the cloud service can take a few minutes, so please be patient.

WARNING: The most recent update of Safari browser on MacOS sometimes does not interpret the colours well in 3D interactive plots and we recommend using Google Chrome for Ubermag.
